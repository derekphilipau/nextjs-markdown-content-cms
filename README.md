# A statically generated CMS using Next.js, Markdown, and TypeScript

This project expands upon the official [blog-starter](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/blog-starter).

Major differences include:

- Support for multiple content types (pages, posts, and tags)
- Frontmatter and shortcodes that allow for embedding components
- Search content with [Fuse.js](https://fusejs.io/)

Content is stored in `public/content/[contentType]`, e.g. `public/content/posts`, `public/content/pages`, and `public/content/tags`. Each piece of content has its own directory with an `index.md` file and any associated assets.

## AI Content

```
Create a whimsical, minimalist illustration that illustrates the following blog post using a pastel color palette. The style should feature clean lines and geometric shapes, with subtle gradients. Incorporate playful, abstract representations of everyday objects or natural elements. The overall composition should feel airy and balanced, with plenty of negative space. Add small, unexpected details that reward closer inspection. The illustration should evoke a sense of joy and wonder, while maintaining a modern, sophisticated edge.
