As designers, we have the power and responsibility to create experiences that are accessible to everyone. While color contrast is often the first thing that comes to mind when we think about accessible design, it's just the tip of the iceberg.

## Beyond Color Contrast

Don't get me wrong - color contrast is crucial. It ensures that text is readable and elements are distinguishable. But accessibility encompasses so much more:

1. **Typography**: Choose fonts that are easily readable and use appropriate sizes.
2. **Layout**: Create a clear visual hierarchy and consistent navigation.
3. **Alternative Text**: Provide descriptive alt text for images.
4. **Keyboard Navigation**: Ensure all interactive elements are accessible via keyboard.
5. **Video Captions**: Include captions for video content.

## Why Accessibility Matters

Accessible design isn't just about compliance or reaching a wider audience (though those are important). It's about creating a more inclusive world where everyone can participate fully, regardless of their abilities.

## My Approach to Accessible Design

When I start a new project, I think about accessibility from the very beginning. Here are a few strategies I use:

- **Empathy Exercises**: I'll navigate my designs using only a keyboard or try to understand them with my eyes closed.
- **Accessible Color Palettes**: I create color schemes that work for various types of color blindness.
- **Testing**: I use accessibility checkers and get feedback from users with different abilities.
- **Flexible Designs**: I create designs that can adapt to different user needs, like text resizing.

## The Challenge and Reward

Designing for accessibility can be challenging. It requires us to think beyond our own experiences and consider a wide range of user needs. But it's also incredibly rewarding. When we design with accessibility in mind, we create better experiences for everyone.

Remember, accessible design is good design. It's not a feature; it's a fundamental aspect of creating products that truly serve all users.
