# From Concept to Creation: My Illustration Process

One of the questions I'm often asked is, "How do you create your illustrations?" Today, I'm pulling back the curtain on my creative process. Whether you're a fellow illustrator or just curious about how digital art comes to life, I hope you'll find this peek behind the scenes interesting!

## Step 1: Ideation

Every illustration starts with an idea. Sometimes it's a client brief, other times it's a concept I want to explore. I always start with a mind map, jotting down words, themes, and visual elements that relate to the central idea.

## Step 2: Rough Sketches

Next, I translate these ideas into quick, loose sketches. These are messy and not meant for anyone else's eyes! The goal is to explore different compositions and get a feel for the overall structure of the illustration.

## Step 3: Refined Sketch

Once I have a direction I like, I create a more detailed sketch. This is where I start to think about the specifics of each element and how they interact with each other.

## Step 4: Color Palette

Color sets the mood of an illustration. I usually create 3-4 color palettes and test them on my sketch before deciding on the final one.

## Step 5: Digital Illustration

Now comes the fun part! I bring my sketch into my digital software of choice and start building up the illustration layer by layer. I start with base colors and gradually add details, textures, and depth.

## Step 6: Refinement

Once the main elements are in place, I step back (literally - I often walk away from my desk at this point) and look at the illustration with fresh eyes. This is where I make small adjustments to color, composition, and details.

## Step 7: Feedback and Final Touches

If it's a client project, this is where I present the illustration for feedback. After any necessary revisions, I add final touches like subtle textures or highlights to really make the illustration pop.

And there you have it! From a spark of an idea to a fully-realized digital illustration. Of course, every project is unique and might require slight variations to this process, but this is the general framework I follow.

What does your creative process look like? I'd love to hear about it in the comments!
