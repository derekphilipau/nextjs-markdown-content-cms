## Hello, I'm Lumi Thorne

I'm a passionate designer and illustrator based in San Francisco, California. With over a decade of experience in the creative industry, I specialize in bringing ideas to life through vibrant visuals and thoughtful design.

## My Journey

My love for art began at an early age, doodling in notebooks and creating stories through pictures. This passion led me to pursue a degree in Graphic Design from the California College of the Arts, where I honed my skills and discovered my love for digital illustration.

## What I Do

- **Graphic Design**: From branding to marketing materials, I create cohesive visual identities that make businesses stand out.
- **Digital Illustration**: I specialize in creating whimsical and colorful illustrations for books, magazines, and digital media.
- **UI/UX Design**: I craft intuitive and beautiful user interfaces for web and mobile applications.

## My Approach

I believe that great design is born from curiosity, empathy, and a dash of playfulness. Each project is an opportunity to learn, explore, and push creative boundaries. I love collaborating with clients to understand their vision and bring it to life in unexpected ways.

## When I'm Not Designing

You can find me exploring the beautiful hiking trails of Northern California, experimenting with new cooking recipes, or sketching people at local cafes. I'm also an avid reader and always on the lookout for inspiring art and design books.
